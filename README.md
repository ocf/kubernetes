# ocf/kubernetes

This is the git repository for the [Open Computing Facility](https://ocf.berkeley.edu/)'s [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io/) cluster. The repository is a [transpire](https://github.com/ocf/transpire) toplevel repository built through GitHub Actions CI and pushed to [ocf/cluster](https://github.com/ocf/cluster), which is then deployed by ArgoCD. The goal is for every non-dynamic Kubernetes object to be generated by a transpire module.

## Deploying Software

1. Create a new Python file in `apps/` with a function `objects()` that yields Kubernetes objects (dicts or `python-kubernetes` objects are both accepted). See the other Python files in that folder for examples. Helper functions are provided for Helm charts, although not all software will use helm charts.
    a. If you need to build your own container image, do so in another git repository. Instructions at [our internal docs](https://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/doc/deploying-services-to-kubernetes-NrroInWHyc) (going public soon).
2. (Root Required) Go to [ArgoCD](https://argo.ocf.berkeley.edu/) and run a sync. Before you click sync, look at the diff to sanity check what will change. We do not automatically sync configuration for safety reasons.

### Code-Test Loop

Install the latest version of [transpire](https://github.com/ocf/transpire). `transpire` is alpha-level software, so you may need to track the `main` branch. There are a few ways to install it (pip, nix), but the quickest way to get started is `pip install git+https://github.com/ocf/transpire.git@main`.

Then, make changes and use some subset of the following commands to test your changes...

```bash
# print all YAML objects to stdout (may want to pipe to less, bat, etc.)
transpire object print $APP_NAME

# apply it to the current cluster your kubectl points to
transpire object apply $APP_NAME
```

## Folder Structure

Our deployment follows the following directory structure...

```
- apps
    - cilium
    - notes
    - ... (any software)
    - versions.toml (all software versions)
- cluster.toml (transpire configuration)
```

## Bootstrapping

A bootstrap script is provided to help bring up new clusters when needed. It installs the bare minimum required to run ArgoCD, provided Kubernetes is already running without a CNI, and `KUBECONFIG` is pointed at the right place.

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
